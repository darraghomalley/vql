# VQL VS Code Extension

Visual compliance indicators for [VQL (Vibe Query Language)](https://github.com/darraghenright/vql) in Visual Studio Code.

## Overview

The VQL VS Code extension brings real-time code quality visualization to your editor. It displays compliance ratings as colored badges in the file explorer and provides an interactive matrix view for comprehensive quality tracking.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ File Explorer Badges
- **Colored Square Indicators**: Shows overall compliance at a glance
  - ðŸŸ© Green = All reviewed principles are High compliance
  - ðŸŸ¨ Amber = Lowest rating is Medium
  - ðŸŸ¥ Red = At least one Low rating
  - ðŸŸª Purple = No principles reviewed yet

### ðŸ“Š Interactive Compliance Matrix
- **Comprehensive Overview**: See all assets and principles in a grid view
- **Color-Coded Cells**: Each cell shows compliance status
  - ðŸŸ© High compliance
  - ðŸŸ¨ Medium compliance  
  - ðŸŸ¥ Low compliance
  - **â€”** Bold hyphen for not reviewed (subtle grey)
- **Click Navigation**: Click any file to open it in the editor
- **Resizable Panes**: Adjust the layout to your preference
- **Principle Details**: View principle guidance (read-only)

### ðŸ”„ Real-Time Updates
- Automatically refreshes when VQL storage changes
- Instant feedback as you review and refactor code
- Seamless integration with VQL CLI operations

### ðŸŽ¨ Theme Integration
- Uses VS Code's theme colors for consistent appearance
- Adapts to light and dark themes
- Respects user's color preferences

## Installation

### From VSIX Package
```bash
# From the vscode-extension directory
npm install
npm run compile
vsce package

# Install the generated VSIX file
code --install-extension vql-vscode-*.vsix
```

### From Source (Development)
```bash
# Clone the VQL repository
git clone https://github.com/darraghenright/vql.git
cd vql/vscode-extension

# Install dependencies and compile
npm install
npm run compile

# Open in VS Code
code .

# Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
```

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85.0 or higher
- VQL CLI installed and project initialized (`vql -su`)
- Active VQL storage file (`VQL/vql_storage.json`)

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Initialize VQL** in your project:
   ```bash
   vql -su
   ```

2. **Add principles**:
   ```bash
   vql -pr -add A Architecture "Clean architecture and separation of concerns"
   vql -pr -add S Security "Input validation and protection against vulnerabilities"
   vql -pr -add P Performance "Efficient algorithms and resource management"
   ```

3. **Track assets**:
   ```bash
   vql -ar -add uc u c "src/controllers/UserController.ts"
   ```

4. **Review code** (via CLI or AI assistant):
   ```bash
   vql :uc.rv(-pr)  # Review all principles
   ```

5. **See results** in VS Code:
   - File explorer shows colored badges
   - Open Command Palette â†’ "VQL: Show Compliance Matrix"

### Understanding the Indicators

#### File Explorer Badges
- Shows a colored square emoji based on the lowest compliance rating
- Hover to see detailed breakdown of all principle ratings
- Purple square (ðŸŸª) indicates no reviews yet

#### Compliance Matrix
- **Rows**: Your tracked assets (files)
- **Columns**: Your defined principles
- **Cells**: Compliance ratings (ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¥ or â€”)
- **File Names**: Colored by overall compliance
- Click cells to see review details and principle guidance

### Commands

Access via Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P):
- `VQL: Show Compliance Matrix` - Open the interactive matrix view (read-only)
- `VQL: Show Metadata` - Edit principles, entities, asset types, and assets
- `VQL: Refresh Decorations` - Manually refresh file badges
- `VQL: Toggle Decorations` - Show/hide compliance badges

## Configuration

The extension reads from your project's `VQL/vql_storage.json` file. No additional configuration is needed - it automatically detects and uses your VQL setup.

### Custom Theme Colors

You can customize the compliance colors in your VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "vql.highCompliance": "#22c55e",
    "vql.mediumCompliance": "#f59e0b",
    "vql.lowCompliance": "#ef4444"
  }
}
```

## Development

### Architecture
The VS Code extension follows a clean separation of concerns:
- **Read Operations**: Direct JSON parsing for fast visualization
- **Write Operations**: All modifications go through the VQL CLI to ensure consistency
- The Metadata view (`vqlMetadataProvider.ts`) properly uses CLI commands for all edits
- The Matrix view is read-only for viewing compliance data

### Project Structure
```
vscode-extension/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ extension.ts          # Main extension entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ decorationProvider.ts # File badge logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ matrixViewProvider.ts # Compliance matrix webview (read-only)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ vqlMetadataProvider.ts # Metadata editor (uses CLI for writes)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ storageReader.ts      # VQL storage parser
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ storageWatcher.ts     # File system watcher
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types.ts              # TypeScript interfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json              # Extension manifest
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json            # TypeScript configuration
```

### Testing

1. Open the extension folder in VS Code
2. Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
3. Open the `testVSCodeUI` folder in the new window
4. Verify badges appear and matrix view works

### Building for Distribution

```bash
# Install vsce globally if needed
npm install -g vsce

# Package the extension
vsce package

# Creates: vql-vscode-{version}.vsix
```

## Troubleshooting

### No badges appearing?
- Ensure VQL is initialized: `vql -su`
- Check for `VQL/vql_storage.json` in your workspace
- Try manual refresh: Command Palette â†’ "VQL: Refresh Decorations"

### Badges show wrong colors?
- Verify your reviews are saved: `vql {asset}?`
- Check compliance ratings are set (H/M/L)
- Ensure paths in VQL storage are relative to workspace root

### Matrix view empty?
- Confirm you have tracked assets: `vql -ar`
- Check browser console for errors (Help â†’ Toggle Developer Tools)
